I want to retrieve data from $disease$
$source$ data for $disease$
I want experiment about $disease$
I need $disease$
Get $data_type$ for $disease$
Get $data_type$ for $tissue$ tissue
$data_type$ for $assembly$
$disease$ $data_type$
$data_type$ from $disease$ for $assembly$
$assembly$ $data_type$ from $disease$
$tissue$ data from $data_type$ for $disease$
$data_type$ from $tissue$
could you retrieve $data_type$ data from $disease$?
$data_type$ from $tissue$
data regarding $data_type$ for cell $cell$
samples for $target$ data
can we have data from [tumoral]{"entity": "is_healthy", "value": "False"} tissue from $tissue$?
$data_type$ of $tissue$ tissue
I am looking for $data_type$
experiments data for $tissue$ from $assembly$
I want experiment about $disease$ for $assembly$
I want $data_type$ for $disease$
$assembly$ $data_type$ of $disease$
data from $assembly$ $data_type$ for $disease$
im looking for $data_type$ from $source$ regarding $disease$
patients with $disease$
I need to select $tissue$ data taken from $source$
I need $tissue$ data taken from $source$
files from $source$ for $assembly$
data regarding $data_type$ for cell line $cell$
i need cell $cell$
$data_type$ of $cell$ cell
can i have $target$ data?
please give me $cell$ data
I would like to have data regarding $tissue$ extracted from $assembly$
can i have $target$ for cell line $cell$
I am looking for $data_type$ data extracted from $source$
data for $tissue$
[tumoral]{"entity": "is_healthy", "value": "False"} patients affected by $disease$
$tissue$ extracted from [healthy]{"entity": "is_healthy", "value": "True"} patients
samples of $cell$ of patients affected by $disease$
I would like to have $assembly$ assembly data regarding $tissue$ of [tumoral]{"entity":"is_healthy", "value":False} patients with $disease$
we would like to have items from $assembly$ from [healthy]{"entity": "is_healthy", "value": "True"} $tissue$
i want data from [healthy]{"entity": "is_healthy", "value": "True"} patients
can we have data from [tumoral]{"entity": "is_healthy", "value": "False"} tissue from $tissue$
i'm looking for data from $source$ regarding [healthy]{"entity": "is_healthy", "value": "True"} patients
